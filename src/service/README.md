# Service App

This is a trivial Ruby Sinatra website that just shows a simple voting form, and records votes in a local yaml file.

## Why?

To be used to check caching behaviour of upstream systems, and to provide some sort of 'dynamic' content that can
be manipulated through an API call (HTTP Post of a vote selection).
